# mistbornV2
Feel free to fork! 
2.1.0
Features: 
1. Allows you to select era 1 or 2, and if Mistborn, full Feruchemy, Twinborns and other such high level powers, are allowed.

2. Randomly sets your Power, Attribute and standing levels as per the rule book. If Mistborn and other high level power system are banned it will set your power to 2 or 1, never 3. Era effects power choice appropriately. Era 1 level 3 allows choice between keeper or mistborn, era 2 generates a twinborn. Note: Currently it is possible to disallow Mistborn and Full Feruchemy, but allow Twinborn, get a power rating of 3 and then set yourself to be era 1, which will allow you to pick Mistborn or Keeper. So urm, don't do that till I have time to fix it.

3. Generates your power randomly if needed, or sets your powers to all if Mistborn. I've allowed Era 2 players to opt out of Gnathood, as it admittedly sucks.

4. Allows you to select between Allo or Feru for your powerset (if you have powers at all.)

5. Tells you the name of your powerset, if relevant. For example if it selects Bronze Bronze foratwinborn, it will tell you are a Seeker Sentry.

6. Allows you to set name. Turns out random name generators are bare effort, might put one in if I update this.

7. Randomly sets height, build, age and nobility. This will really force players to "roll with what they got" and build around their stats. There are options for Height and Age to set a rough area (tall, average and small for height, old, average and young for age) if you want a general theme but have decided entirely on a number or you can go full random.

8. Saves stats to a small .txt file, which can be edited if you really want to change something. The file will appear in the folder you saved the .exe to.
